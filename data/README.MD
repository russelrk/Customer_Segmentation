## Data

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle, which contains the data needed for analysis. To acquire the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vetrirah/customer).

2. If you don't have a Kaggle account, you will need to sign up for one.

3. Once logged in, click the "Download" button on the Kaggle dataset page to download the dataset file. The file may be in CSV or other formats.

4. Save the downloaded dataset file to the `data/` directory in this project repository.

Your project's data is now ready for analysis. You can refer to the data preprocessing and analysis sections in this README for further information on how to use the dataset in your project.
