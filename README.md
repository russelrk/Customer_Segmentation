## Project Description

In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchase history, demographic information, or other relevant features. The goal is to discover patterns and gain a better understanding of the customer base. This segmentation can be valuable for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and improving customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Customer segmentation using machine learning algorithms
- Visualizations and insights
- Evaluation of segmentation results
